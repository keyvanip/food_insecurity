# Project Repo

Hi professors!

Here is our project on food security metrics, primarily in Africa and Europe. We have five types of visualizations for you, some in multiples: line plot, scatter plot, bubble chart, histogram/bar chart, and chloropleth. Our innovative view is the first scatter plot; our linked view is the final visualization, the third scatter plot. All scatterplots and the histogram also satisfy the 'better tooltip on hover' requirement (I'm paraphrasing but you get it)

**Some things to note:**

1. We  did not do our work in this repo. We made our own. It is public and can be found here if you'd like to follow our myriad commits and wrangles with github : https://github.com/hannah-hana-kim/DSAN-5200-Project/

2. Our img folder contains some visualizations that were not used in the final product. Additionally, **all visualizations were intended to be viewed in the index.html file** which you can find in the FinalWebsite/\_site folder. Some of them will look real funky out of that context; please don't judge them too harshly.

3. You will need to have an active internet connection when viewing our index. I don't know why you wouldn't but figured I'd mention it

4. We did not include a renv since it kept breaking on us. We did include an .Rproj object which when opened acts as a renv.
